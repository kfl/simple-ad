SML Implementation of Automatic Differentiation
===============================================

Ken's simple-minded and (hopefully) easy to understand implementation
of AD. The implementation is done in SML for two reasons:

 * To make sure that no "advanced" language features was used by
   accident (looking at you Haskell). Thus, everything should be
   easily ported to other languages.

 * To have relatively easy access to imperative features. Meaning that
   we are explicit about when we are using imperative features, and
   don't use them by accident, but only use them when it is essential
   for the algorithm. Still, the use of imperative features shouldn't
   be a big deal.

Both reasons are for focusing on what is state of the art.

The main use for code was for illustration during a number of talks
introducing AD.

Files
-----

 * `Simple.sml` simple forward-mode explained as fusion of `eval` and
   `diff`. Doesn't depend on any other files.

 * `Expr.sml` utility modules declaring the AST data type for
   expressions parameterized types for the labels at variables and
   (sub-)expressions. Helper functions for generating test expressions
   of varying size, and for printing expressions. Used by `Forward`
   and `Reverse`.

 * `Forward.sml` declares functions for symbolic differentiation and
   for forward-mode AD for multivariate functions.

 * `Reverse.sml` declares three different implementations of
   reverse-mode AD for multivariate functions:

   * `reverse` a fully functional implementation, show the three
     essential phases of reverse-mode: eval and decorate of
     sub-expressions, push derivatives to leafs, and sum all leaves
     per variable.

   * `reverse_fused` fuse the last two phases, and keep derivatives in
     an array, rather than at the labels at the leaves.

   * `reverse_imp` don't rebuild the AST during the first phase, but
     update the imperative references in the labels at the
     sub-expressions. Avoiding the rebuilding of AST is essential,
     because it destroys sharing and can thereby change the
     asymptotically complexity.
